# PasswordGenerator

THIS IS A PASSWORD GENERATOR

This is a program that generates a randomized password
You enter the appropiate values (1-150_) in the prompt
You are then asked if you would like to use Uppercase
You are then asked if you would like to use Numbers
After you have selected each option or chose to cancel which results in a "no"
You are presented with your new generated password


Have a great day!
